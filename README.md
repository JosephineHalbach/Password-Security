## Password Checker


Overview:

This project provides a simple yet powerful solution to address the critical cybersecurity concern of password security. By leveraging modern web technologies and integrating with the Have I Been Pwned API, users can quickly check if their passwords have been compromised in data breaches, empowering them to make informed decisions about their online security.

Features:
Secure Password Checking: Utilizes the SHA-1 cryptographic hash function to securely process user passwords without transmitting them over the network in plaintext, ensuring user privacy and data security.
Real-time Feedback: Provides users with instant feedback on the security status of their passwords, enabling them to take proactive measures to strengthen their online security.
Easy Integration: Can be seamlessly integrated into existing web applications or used as a standalone tool for password security assessment.

Usage:
Simply input your password into the provided form.
Click the "Check" button to initiate the password security check.
Receive instant feedback on whether your password has been compromised in data breaches.

Technical Details:
Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
API Integration: Utilizes the Have I Been Pwned API, an industry-standard service that aggregates data breaches and password leaks.
Cryptographic Techniques: Implements the SHA-1 hashing algorithm to securely process user passwords without compromising user privacy.

Educational Significance:
This project serves as an educational resource for cybersecurity awareness programs, courses, and workshops.
