# Password-Security
This code sets up a web page where users can input a password, and upon submission, it checks if the password has been compromised in a data breach using the Have I Been Pwned API. The result is then displayed on the page.

You can include this code in your GitHub portfolio to showcase your cybersecurity skills, particularly your ability to develop secure web applications and integrate with external APIs for security-related purposes. Make sure to include appropriate documentation and comments to explain your code and its purpose.
